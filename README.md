# Simple-Rust-Malware
Windows Rust Keylogger

## Requirement
* A recent build of Rust
* A Windows Machine
* Cargo
   
## Cargo.toml

```
[target.'cfg(windows)'.dependencies]
winapi = { version = "0.3", features = ["sysinfoapi", "synchapi", "libloaderapi", "errhandlingapi", "winuser", "fileapi", "winnt", "minwinbase", "winbase", "handleapi", "libloaderapi"] }
widestring = "*"
```

## How to build
**1. Make sure you have the latest Rust and Cargo on your Windows machine**

**2. Clone the [source] with `git`:**
   ```sh
   $ git clone https://github.com/cdong1012/Simple-Rust-Malware.git
   $ cd Simple-Rust-Malware
   ```
[source]: https://github.com/cdong1012/Simple-Rust-Malware

**3. Configure the log path:**
  - In `src\main.rs`, change the path **C:\Users\chuon\OneDrive\Desktop\testing_malware\log.txt** to the path where you want your log to be stored at.
  - Preferably, a path to a folder where you(or the current user) have permission to write to. 
   
**4. Build the package**
    - In our current repository, run `cargo build` to build this package.
    
**5. Run the malware**

  - There are two ways to run the malware executable
   
      1. Run with `cargo run` after you build it
        
      2. Run directly with the .exe file. You can find and run the executable at 
      ***C:\Users\chuon\OneDrive\Desktop\Simple_Rust_Malware\Simple-Rust-Malware\target\debug\malware_simple.exe***. 
      
**6. How to stop capturing**
  - You can hit `Ctrl-C` on the Command Prompt that is running the malware to stop capturing keystroke.
  - After you have done this, you can view the log text file to see what we have captured.

**7. Log file**
  - After you are done capturing, you should see something like this
